# countryScratchMap
This program is still in development...

 The program currently allows the user to input all countries they have visited and in what year. The program will store this data in a .JSON file. The program will then consist of a variety of data visualisation options as well as a webservice API. The API will display a virtual scratch map of the world showing all the countries that have been visited.
